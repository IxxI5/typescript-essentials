# TypeScript Essentials With Real-World Examples

Author: IxxI5

### Description

This repository offers a fresh and engaging approach to mastering the essentials of TypeScript programming. By using small, simulated real-world examples, it makes learning both intuitive and practical. Whether you're a beginner just starting out or an advanced user looking to deepen your understanding, this method is designed to keep you engaged. The idea is simple: the more you practice, the more you retain. In the end, mastering programming comes down to three thingsâ€”practice, practice, and practice. This hands-on approach ensures that learning is not only easier but also more enjoyable and effective for everyone.

### Prerequisites

- **VS Code** is installed or download it from: https://code.visualstudio.com/

- **Node JS** is installed or download the latest version from: https://nodejs.org/en

### Launch a sub-project

After downloading the typescript-essentials repository, follow these steps:

- **Unzip** the downloaded file.
- **Open** VS Code Terminal
- **Install Dependencies** through VS Code Terminal:

  ```javascript
  npm install                        /* install the dependencies */
  ```

- **Launch** a sub-project e.g. ts01_basic_types from Terminal:

  ```javascript
  npm run build:ts01                 /* compiles the ts01_basic_types/index.ts to
                                        ts01_basic_types/index.js */

  npm run start:ts01                 /* runs the ts01_basic_types/index.js */
  ```

**Important Note:**
The following sections, **VS Code Configuration** and **Project Configuration**, provide general guidelines for setting up your own TypeScript projects.

### VS Code Configuration

- **Open** the VS Code Terminal and execute the following commands:

  ```javascript
  mkdir myProject                    /* creates the myProject directory */

  npm install -g typescript          /* install TypeScript globally */

  /* Important Note: Once TypeScript is installed globally, you don't need to reinstall it
     for any new project. */
  ```

### Project Configuration

- **Open** the VS Code Terminal and execute the following commands:

  ```javascript
  tsc --init                         /* create the tsconfig.json */
  ```

- **Create** a **tsconfig.json** file, and enter the following:

  ```javascript
  {
  "target": "es2019", // or "es6", "es2016", "es2017", etc.
  "module": "commonjs", // or another module system
  "strict": true, // Optional, for strict type-checking
  "esModuleInterop": true, // Optional, allows default imports from modules
  "skipLibCheck": true, // Optional, skips type checking of declaration files
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["es2019", "dom"], // Add "dom" to the lib array
    "outDir": "./dist/", // Output directory for compiled files
    "rootDir": "./src/", // Source files directory (current directory)
    "sourceMap": false // Optional, generates source maps
  },
  "include": [
    "**/*" // Include all TypeScript files in this directory and subdirectories
  ],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
  }
  ```

  Save the modified **tsconfig.json** file.

- **Create** the **src** and **dist** directories using the VS Code UI or Terminal:

  ```javascript
  mkdir src                          /* creates the src folder */

  mkdir dist                         /* creates the dist folder */
  ```

- **Create** the **package.json** file using the Terminal:

  ```javascript
   npm init                           /* creates the package.json file, which contains the
                                         project's description and manages its dependencies
                                         (packages) */
  ```

  Press **Enter** for all prompts. Open the **package.json** file and modify it as needed.

- **Modify** the **package.json** file as follows:

  ```javascript
  {
  "name": "myProject",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Project Description",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "build:myProject": "npx tsc --project src/tsconfig.json",
    "start:myProject": "node dist/index.js"
  },
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT"
  }
  ```

- **Create** the **index.ts** file and write some code e.g.:

  ```javascript
  let greeting: string = "Hello, World!";
  console.log(greeting);
  ```

  Press save.

- **Launch** the myProject from Terminal:

  ```javascript
  npm run build:myProject                 /* compiles the myProject/src/index.ts to
                                             myProject/dist/index.js */

  npm run start:myProject                 /* runs the myProject/dist/index.js */
  ```
